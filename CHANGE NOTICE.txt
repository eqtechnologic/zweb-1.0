                 NOTICE REGARDING MIGRATION TO JAKARTA EE
=======================================================================

Dear Contributors and Users,

This is to inform you that significant changes have been made in the project to migrate from `javax` namespace to `jakarta` namespace. This migration is part of the ongoing efforts to support Jakarta EE, the community-driven specification for enterprise Java.

### Changes Made:

- **Packages Migration:**
  All occurrences of the `javax` packages have been updated to use the corresponding `jakarta` packages.

- **Dependencies Update:**
  Dependencies that were relying on `javax` artifacts, if any, have been updated to use their `jakarta` counterparts.

- **Configuration Changes:**
  Relevant configuration files, if any, have been modified to reflect the changes in package names.

Note: Not all `javax.*` packages are part of Java EE. Only those defined by Java
EE have moved to the `jakarta.*` namespace.
